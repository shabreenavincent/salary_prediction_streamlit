# 💼 Salary Prediction App (Streamlit)

This is a Machine Learning-based web application built using **Streamlit** that predicts employee salaries (in USD and INR) based on job title, company location, experience level, and other relevant features. The backend is powered by trained ML models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, with Random Forest selected as the best performer.

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts salary in **USD** and auto-converts to **INR**
- Easy-to-use **Streamlit** interface
- Accepts user input for job-related features
- Compares predictions across multiple ML models
- Includes **exploratory data analysis**, **feature engineering**, and **model evaluation**
- Built with **VS Code**, deployed via **GitHub**, and powered by **Python**

## 📂 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Streamlit**
- **Git & GitHub**
